  <h1>Summary: Latitude vs. X</h1>
  <p>
      The purpose of this project is to analyse how the weather changes as you get closer to the equator. To accomplish this we first pulled data from the OpenWeatherMap API to assemble a data set on over 500 cities. 
  </p>
  <p>
      After assembling the dataset, we used Matplotlib to plot various aspects of the weather vs. latitude. Factors we looked at included: temperature, cloudiness, wind speed and humidity. This site provides the source data and visualizations created as part of the analysis as well as any explainations and descriptions of correlations and trends observed.
